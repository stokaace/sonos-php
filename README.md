sonos-php
=========

A PHP API for Sonos Music Players

The code is designed and tested running PHP on a Synology Diskstation with very minimal PHP plugins.

In addition to basic functionality I've implemented a listener functionality which can detect state changes on any Sonos speaker and fire an http request to any URL. I plan to use this to notify a Harmony remote to turn on our stereo when the Sonos connector starts playing.
